## Hi, I'm Erik 👋

I'm a Python developer who enjoys building **production-ready systems** and learning by shipping real projects.

- clean architecture, testing & CI/CD

🔍 **Currently open to junior / entry-level Python developer roles.**

📍 Based in Germany, open to remote opportunities.  
🗣️ I work comfortably in English and am happy to collaborate with international teams.
